# JavaVec
JavaVec is a Java library built for vectors and vector operations in linear 
algebra. Partly a useful albeit trivial tool, partly an exercise of my own
understanding of linear algebra.

# Installation
You may download the .jar file in the Release section of the repository. 
Just put the .jar file in your own project and configure your Java 
project to use it.

You may also clone the repo and build the tool by yourself. The **Ant** 
building tool is required for building process.

# Usage

# Features to be implemented 

[ ] Basic `Vector` class (constructing vectors, length, equality, `toString()`) 

[ ] Basic operations (scalar multiplication, addition, dot product)
